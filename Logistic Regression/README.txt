In each command logistic_regression is the function name and rest 3 are the input parameters for the program.


go to the command prompt and type this--->>

logistic_regression('pendigits_training.txt',1,'pendigits_test.txt')
logistic_regression('pendigits_training.txt',2,'pendigits_test.txt')

logistic_regression('yeast_training.txt',1,'yeast_test.txt.txt')
logistic_regression('yeast_training.txt.txt',1,'yeast_test.txt')

logistic_regression('satellite_training.txt',1,'satellite_test.txt')
